# P18.-Hypothesis-Testing-2-Sample-2-Tail-Test-Drugs-and-Placebos-
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71163471/118789070-0905da00-b8b2-11eb-964d-5d5ac1604e62.png)

Note: This python code states both 2-sample 1-tail and 2-sample 2-tail codes

Treatment group mean is Mu1 Contrl group mean is Mu2 2-sample 2-tail ttest Assume Null Hypothesis Ho as Mu1 = Mu2 Thus Alternate Hypothesis Ha as Mu1 ≠ Mu2

As No direct code for 2-sample 1-tail ttest available with unknown SD and arrays of means

Hence we find probability using 2-sample 2-tail ttest and divide it by 2 to get 1-tail ttest

Inference: Since (p-value = 0.0062) < (α = 0.05); Reject Null Hypothesis i.e. Mu1 ≠ Mu2 Placebo control is not similar to Treatment by drugs
